# Issues-Creator

# In this repository, you can find a compressed folder with the Chrome Plugin. 
This plugin is designed to create issues on the gitHub repository. 
In this version, issues will be automatically added to this repository, but you can customize the plugin for yourself by replacing the data in the popup.jsx file.
